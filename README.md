# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title and to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This report summarises the analysis in order to help Bobby’s manager for what they refer to as “silver tsunami”, as many of the current employees reach retirement age. 

### Results
Four tables have been created for this analysis that can be accessed below


* [Mentorship Eligbility](https://github.com/shayanafzal/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/09a7bb9114e1a0a2a29104cade0764985adc0057/Data/mentorship_eligibilty.csv)
* [Retirement Titles](https://github.com/shayanafzal/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/09a7bb9114e1a0a2a29104cade0764985adc0057/Data/retirement_titles.csv)
* [Unique Titles](https://github.com/shayanafzal/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/09a7bb9114e1a0a2a29104cade0764985adc0057/Data/unique_titles.csv)
* [Retiring Titles](https://github.com/shayanafzal/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/09a7bb9114e1a0a2a29104cade0764985adc0057/Data/retiring_titles.csv)

The SQL coding use to generate these results can be accessed [here](https://github.com/shayanafzal/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/09a7bb9114e1a0a2a29104cade0764985adc0057/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis-Challenge%20Code.sql).

Four major points from the two analysis deliverables

1. The tables titled 'Unique Titles' can be accessed [here](https://github.com/shayanafzal/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/09a7bb9114e1a0a2a29104cade0764985adc0057/Data/unique_titles.csv) and it shows the employee numbers, first name, last name and the current title of all employee that is fall into the "silver tsunami" indicating exactly the position that will need to be fulfilled in the near future.  

2. The result show that the highest number of employees retiring are those working as Senior Engineers and Senior Staff. This makes sense as it is safe to assume that senior positions at the company are being held by those that have been working in the industry for a long time and are close towards reaching their retirement age. The retiring titles summary can be found [here](https://github.com/shayanafzal/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/8124dba37867c14516415d4acba45fdebc7eca1a/Data/retiring_titles.csv). There results are also summarized below.

3. The result also show that only 2 of the managers will be retiring. Hence, the others mananagers currently employed at the company can be trained to move into higher positions that will open up once the senior employees start to retire.

4. As a second part of this analysis, we determined current employees who are ideal candidates to be mentored into senior roles that will open up in the near future. The complete table can be accessed [here](https://github.com/shayanafzal/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/09a7bb9114e1a0a2a29104cade0764985adc0057/Data/mentorship_eligibilty.csv). This table lists a total of 1549 candidates that are ideal for mentorship. This will help the business plan ahead and invest in the training and mentorship of their current stuff for senior level position that will open up in teh near future.




### Summary
Roles that will need to be filled as the “silver tsunami” begins to make an impact
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
