# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title and to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This report summarises the analysis in order to help Bobby’s manager for what they refer to as “silver tsunami”, as many of the current employees reach retirement age. 

### Results
Four major points from the two analysis deliverables

1. The result show that the highest number of employees retiring are those working as Senior Engineers and Senior Staff. This makes sense as it is safe to assume that senior positions at the company are being held by those that have been working in the industry for a long time and are close towards reaching their retirement age. The retiring titles summary can be found [here](https://github.com/shayanafzal/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/8124dba37867c14516415d4acba45fdebc7eca1a/Data/retiring_titles.csv). There results are also summarized below.




5. The result also show that only 2 of the managers will be retiring. Hence, the others mananagers currently employed at the company can be trained to move into higher positions that will open up once the senior employees start to retire.




### Summary
Roles that will need to be filled as the “silver tsunami” begins to make an impact
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
